# BI-stat-course-2022

This repository contains homeworks for Biostatitistic course in Bioinformatics Institute (2022-2023).

## Olympic games homework (first project)

This homework is dedicated to analysis of the olympic games data. In *data_folder* zipped-file can be found. The file should be unzipped before the analysis. Use `sudo apt-get install unzip` and `unzip athletes_events.zip -d destination_folder` command in the terminal. 

The .zip file contains several .csv-tabels. The python code in the current folder is able to combine these (or any other) .csv files with olympic games data.  

In the *data_folder* there is requierements.txt with needed packages for the script launching.
